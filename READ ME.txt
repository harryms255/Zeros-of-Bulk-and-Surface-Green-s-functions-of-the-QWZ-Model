README for Zeros of Surface Green's Functions of the QWZ Model

Set of functions to calculate the bulk and surface Green's functions of the QWZ Model [PRB 92,085126 (2006)], a simple 2 band Chern insulator.There are functions that calculate the surface Green's function from the tight-binding model, recursively [J.Phys.F:Met.Phys. 15 851 (1985)] and analytically [Phys.Scr. 34 257 (1986)]. The edge bands and luttinger surfaces can also be calculated [PRB 106 L081112 (2022) ,http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18820] by calculations of the singular value decompositions of the surface Green's function. These can be calculated with disorder and symmetry breaking (breaking the P^2=1 PHS) as well.

Parameters Used:

Ny: Int
   Size of the system perpedicular to the edge

omega: Float
    Energy in Green's function

eta: positive imaginary
   Small imaginary regularisation (omega+eta)

kx: Float between -pi and pi
 Momentum along parrallel to the edge

y: Float,
   Propogation distance perpendicular to the interface in the Green's function

t: Float,
   Bandwidth, set to 1 to make everything unitless

mu: Float, 
    chemical potential, in units of t

alpha: Complex
    Nearest Neighbour Pairing (effective SOC)

Disorder: List of random numbers of length of Ny
    Randomised disorder added to each site

SB: float
   Symmetry break potetial that breaks the particle-hole symmetry of the model
